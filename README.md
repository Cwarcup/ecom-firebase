## Authentication

Uses Firebase Authentication. See [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/).

Learn:
- using the `signInWithPopup` method to obtain a users `accessToken`. This is used to authenticate with the backend.
  - We can use this `accessToken` to make CRUD requests to the backend.
